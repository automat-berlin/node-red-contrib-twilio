# Node-RED Call Control for Twilio速 TwiML速 platforms

This repository contains a collection of nodes which implement a [Twilio compliant API](https://www.twilio.com/docs).

## Quickstart

You can get hands-on experience with Node-RED and Twilio nodes by deploying them to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). You only need a free account (no credit card required).

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Note: The 'Deploy to Heroku' button will not work properly if your browser is removing the Referer HTTP header from the request.

## Installation

Prerequisite: You need to have a running Node-RED instance. If you do not have it installed yet, read the [Node-RED Getting Started guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/).

### Install the last released version from the Node-RED dashboard

The easiest way to install Twilio nodes is to use the `Manage palette` option in the Node-RED menu (in the top right corner of its dashboard). Switch to the `Install` tab and search for `@automat-berlin/node-red-contrib-twilio`. There should be only one result. Click the `install` button next to it.

### Installation from the source code

First, clone this repository. Optionally switch to the desired branch.

Next, go to the Node-RED install directory, typically `~/.node-red`, and install the cloned package there.

```sh
cd ~/.node-red/
npm install <path-to-cloned-repository>
```

## Configuration

You should be aware of how to configure Node-RED ([read the docs here](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/settings-file)).

The following instructions assume that you are using the `settings.js` file for the configuration (found in the user directory or specified with `-s` command-line argument).

### Set baseUrl for StatusCallback

The base URL will be used to create an absolute `StatusCallback` URL (read more about callback requests [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml#ending-the-call-callback-requests)).

Find the `functionGlobalContext` object and add the `baseUrl` property with the base URL of your Node-RED deployment.

```javascript
    ...
    functionGlobalContext: {
        baseUrl: 'http://example.com'
    },
    ...
```

## Tests

First, go to the repository's main directory and install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then to run all tests use this command:

```sh

```
